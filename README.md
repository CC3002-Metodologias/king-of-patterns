# King of patterns

Examples of using several design patterns to emulate a TCG inspired by Yu-Gi-Oh!

## Exercise 1

Each player has a mat to play cards.
Using a _Test Driven Development_ approach:

1.  Create two zones in the mat, one to play magic cards and another one to play monster 
    cards.
2.  Limit each zone so each one can have at most five cards.
